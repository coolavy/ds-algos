# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to this repository, where youâ€™ll find a collection of various data structures and algorithms. I'm constantly working on adding more, so be sure to check back for updates!

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

### 1. **Segment Trees**
- Currently includes basic **Segment Tree** implementation.
- Future plans: Adding **Lazy Segment Trees** for efficient range updates and queries.

### 2. **Graph Algorithms**
- Currently includes some foundational **Graph Algorithms**.
- Future plans: Expanding the list with advanced algorithms for tasks like shortest path, spanning trees, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Future Plans
This repository is a work in progress, and I will be adding new algorithms and data structures regularly. Stay tuned for:
- **Advanced Graph Algorithms**
- **Tree Algorithms**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
